# Revision history for telomare

## Unreleased

* Reorganized the library into compiler-stage modules: `Telomare.Parse`,
  `Telomare.Expand`, `Telomare.Desugar`, `Telomare.Resolve`,
  `Telomare.TypeCheck`, `Telomare.Size` (+ `.IR`) with the shared
  `Telomare.Machine` step algebra, `Telomare.Eval.Reference` /
  `Telomare.Eval.Meter`, and `Telomare.Driver`. The IR vocabulary moved
  to `Telomare.IR.*` and the error types to `Telomare.Error`.
* Parser APIs now expose an explicit parse-then-expand pipeline. Each surface
  phase has its own term type: the parser produces `ParsedSurfaceTerm` (base
  functor `ParsedTermF` = `UnprocessedParsedTermF` plus the `SugarTermF`
  fragment), and `Telomare.Expand` removes the sugar fragment, returning
  `ExpandedSurfaceTerm` — so expanded trees structurally cannot contain raw
  sugar forms. `Telomare.Desugar` then returns `DesugaredSurfaceTerm`, whose
  case capability is uninhabited, and only that type enters name resolution.
  Module syntax uses `ModuleItem`/`ImportDecl`; expansion retains imports as
  typed `ExpandedModuleItem` values instead of encoding them as arbitrary
  terms. Complete expression runners reject trailing input. The old
  parse-time expansion APIs and `Telomare.Parse.Sugar` module were removed.
* Fixed parser and elaboration correctness issues around oversized naturals,
  keyword boundaries, empty list definitions, generated-pattern capture, UDT
  arity truncation, import failures/cycles, and shadowed builtin rewrites.
* Removed dead code: the unbuildable benchmarks, the C serializer FFI
  (`cbits/`, `ctest/`), the commented-out HVM/LLVM/Chez backends,
  `Telomare.Decompiler`, and orphaned fixture files.
* Removed the `telomare-evaluare` executable and its flake app; its
  interactive evaluation functionality lives in the LSP app now.
* Fixed every GHC `-Wall` warning across the library, executables, and test
  suites (unused imports, name shadowing, incomplete patterns, missing
  signatures, orphan instances, type defaults), and enabled `-Wall`
  permanently for every component in `telomare.cabal`. Orphan instances moved to
  their proper homes: `MonadFail (Either ResolverError)` to `Telomare.Error`,
  `TelomareLike CompiledExpr` to `Telomare.IR.Core`, and the
  `PrettyPrintable` `Char`/`FunctionIndex` instances to
  `Telomare.PrettyPrint`.
* Removed a further ~1,100 lines of dead code across the library, the
  executables and the test suites, including the unused `super*`/`indexed*`
  step family in `Telomare.Machine` and test scaffolding reachable from nothing
  live. Every component now also carries `-Wunused-packages`, and the
  build is warning-free under it.
* Consolidated duplicated logic behind shared abstractions: `Telomare.Util`
  (one `debugTrace`, `padRight` and `plural` where there were six, four and
  two), `Telomare.Lexical` (reserved words, identifier character classes and
  comment delimiters, now read by both the parser and the language server),
  `traverseScoped` in `Telomare.IR.Surface` (one binding-aware traversal of the
  surface functor replacing five hand-written scope walks), and `purely` in
  `Telomare.Machine` (the pure step functions are derived from the monadic ones
  rather than written out a second time).
* Fixed three drifts between the language server's lexer and the parser, all of
  which came from the lexer restating parser facts: `where` was highlighted as
  a keyword though the language does not reserve it, identifiers could only
  start with an ASCII letter, and `{- -}` block comments were never lexed.
* Added `test/ConformanceTests.hs`, a corpus-driven check that the sized
  evaluator, the step meter and the fast runtime agree on the programs they can
  all run.
* Fixed `topologicalSort` in `Telomare.Resolve`, which existed twice with the
  two copies returning opposite orders.
* Fixed the nix build, which had stopped compiling the test suites: it builds
  from `cabal sdist` output, and the Telomare programs the tests read at run
  time were no longer declared in `telomare.cabal`.
* Moved to GHC 9.10.3 and `cabal-version` 3.12, and updated every flake input.

## 0.1.0.0 -- YYYY-mm-dd

* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
