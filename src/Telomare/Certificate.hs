-- |The static report: everything the compiler knows about a program's
-- recursion without running it.
--
-- Two analyses feed it, and they answer different questions:
--
--   * the sizing pass ("Telomare.Size") says how many times each recursion
--     can iterate. That is the number that makes the program total, and it
--     costs minutes to find.
--   * the structural pass ("Telomare.Levels") says how recursions nest, and
--     which bindings are used below the level they were bound at. That costs
--     milliseconds.
--
-- They are reported together, in one command, but /not/ merged into one table,
-- because they do not index the same thing. Sizing allocates a count per
-- __instantiation__: a `d2c` called from two places is sized separately at
-- each, so @simpleplus.tel@ line 12 holds two sized sites. The structural pass
-- indexes the __triple as written__, so it sees `d2c`'s one `{t, r, b}` where
-- it is defined. Lining the two lists up row by row would be a fiction; the
-- report says so rather than inventing a correspondence.
--
-- The iteration counts are not a new claim. They are the numbers the compiler
-- already bakes into the program, and a program whose counts cannot be found
-- does not compile. The levels are an approximation, and say so.
